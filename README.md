# [SAS Project 2: Creating HTML and Listing Reports with Excel files](https://github.com/breanusiem/SAS-Project-2)
 - Imports data from an Excel file named ufo with a workseet named Sightings to create a listing report displaying the descriptor portion of the Excel sheet and an HTML report displaying the data portion of the Excel sheet
 - Creates a variable named region that is assigned a value based on each observation's state, a variable named Week that categorizes the date of the sighting into one of six weeks, and a variable named Duration that is assigned a value based on the value of the duration being less than a minute, 1 to 5 minutes, or more than 5 minutes
